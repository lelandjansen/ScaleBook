## Algorithms explained

### Introduction
Before diving into the algorithms, it is important to know a bit of music theory.

Below is an image of a piano keyboard with the corresponding note names.

#### Semitones
A semitone is simply the distance between two adjacent notes (white or black). For example, one semitone is the distance between the notes:
- C and C-sharp
- E and F
- G and A-flat
- et cetera

A tone is equivalent to two semitones, or the distance between three adjacent notes. For example, one tone is the distance between the notes:
- C and D
- E and F-sharp
- B-flat and C
- et cetera

#### Scales
A musical scale is a pattern notes. For example, the major (ionian) scale follows the semitone pattern:
2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1

The scale C major starts on the note C and follows the major scale pattern. Thus, the notes of the C major are:
C | D | E | F | G | A | B | (C)

ScaleBook knows the following scales:
- Major
- Minor
- Ionian
- Dorian
- Phrygian
- Lydian
- Mixolydian
- Aeolian
- Locrian
- Blues
- Chromatic
- Pentatonic
- Whole tone

Songs and other musical compositions are usually built upon a scale, meaning the notes in that piece are based on the notes in the scale. The two most common scales are the major and minor scales, often described as sounding "happy" and "sad", respectively.
